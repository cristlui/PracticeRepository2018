AA already has a top notch mobile application that allows people to transact with us, but we see an opportunity to improve their experience. *SmAArt Journey* will enable customers to communicate their feedback directly to pertinent business owners across the enterprise. When coupled with robust backend analytics, including features like “heat maps”, our operations leaders will gain nearly real time visibility of previously unavailable insights or valuable nuances on data they already use. The mobile application will provides us the opportunity to dramatically improve our customer’s experience throughout their journey.
